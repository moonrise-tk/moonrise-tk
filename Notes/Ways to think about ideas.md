# Ways to think about ideas

When someone is synthesizing with ideas, multiple ideas can be involved. The way each idea is used depends on the connection it has with other ideas. 

So for example, and this is very meta, I'm trying to think about how to recreate evergreen notes with SwiftUI. Here, evergreen notes are just a concept and way of thinking, and SwiftUI is just a tool. Putting those together lets me synthesize about how to reimagine the concept in SwiftUI.
