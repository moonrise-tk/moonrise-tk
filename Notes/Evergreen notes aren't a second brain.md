# Evergreen notes aren't a "second brain"

I've come across a lot of people referring to Evergreen notes or even notes in general as a "second brain". I think it makes more sense to think of the notes as a snapshot of your first brain; they are, after all, just thoughts that your brain is having at the moment.

Maybe you can think of thoughts in your brain as temporary; unless you think about it constantly, they fade out. On the other hand, notes that are written are relatively permanent. If you revisit notes a year later, they will have the same content and quality as when they were first written.
