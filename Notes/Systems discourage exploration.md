# Systems usually discourage exploration

When getting introduced to a new system, the first thing a user wants to do is play and explore. However, too often the system either places stringent requirements on the user requiring a large learning curve or the user is allowed to roam, and as the user learns how to organize the work they're doing correctly, cleaning up their previous work becomes a necessary chore.

This is unfortunate bc it goes against people's first instinct which is to play. A lot of the times we even stop and force ourselves to learn all of the structure and organization properly first before diving in (mostly in fear that we'll mess up something and have to fix it later).
