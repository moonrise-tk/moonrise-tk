# Complexity scales linearly in well-designed mediums of creation

Frameworks like React, or Wordpress, or anything that is meant to be used for people to create things always advertise "Look how easy it is to create this!". I realized that the true measure of how easy a platform is to use isn't how easy it is to create a single beautiful looking app or page but instead how easy it stays as you try to make more difficult/complex projects

For example, I could give you the code for a beautifully designed website, and point out using it would be as easy as copy-pasting the code. However, if you want to change the code (perhaps you want to use different colors or insert your own data), the complexity and difficulty to use spikes up. You might have to go through all of the source code to understand how to do something as simple as change the theme colors around.

I was talking to Steve from Storyscript, and I didn't realize it at the time but Storyscript is definitely one such medium of creation. He was talking about how he despises low-code platforms like Zapier and Tray, and I drew parallels between them and the original frameworks I described. Those apps make it "easy" to do trivial things like "Every time I get a slack message, ping me." But suppose a user wanted to add a little bit more complexity to that; unless the original developers though of it, it could very well be impossible. 

The problem then seems to be that things the developers wanted to make easy will be easy but things they didn't think of will be very very difficult.

Oddly enough, I think this is where AI could come in. Every time you download a software, you don't get your own personal developer to guide you through what may or may not be possible through their framework. An AI that could ship with the product that not only understands the whole product but can understand your goal and help you get there.
