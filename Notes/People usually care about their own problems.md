# People usually care about their own problems

[[I'm capable because of my privilege]], but despite all the capability, I'm only going to address problems that are relevant to me. 

What are problems relevant to me? I need to find a good note-taking app (Notion, Roam, Bear). My emails are very cluttered (HEY). My computer's keyboard breaks, so I'm thinking of buying a new computer (Apple, Microsoft). 

I'm not worried about putting food on the table, paying hospital bills for my mom, or being mugged when I walk in a shady alleyway. 

The teams behind Notion, Roam, Bear, or HEY spend years on a tool that are targeted to people like them; people with enough privilege and freedom to think about what note-taking app to use. I'm not attacking them, merely pointing out a fact.

On the other hand, people from different socio-economic backgrounds may never have the tools to make changes to their society.
