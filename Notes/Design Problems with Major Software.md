# Design Problems with Major Software

I look at problems and frustrating experiences with Spotify, iOS, and MacOS.

**1. Spotify**

- The songs I “heart” on my phone occasionally do not update with the songs I heart on my computer. When that happens, I don’t even know how to make them update save a full restart of my computer.
- I can’t share my song library with other people like I can with playlists.I can’t queue playlists or albums. Only. Individual. Songs.
- To add songs to my library when they’re playing, the icon is a heart (next to WINTER above). However to add songs when I’m just looking through a playlist, the icon is a plus button. And recently, they’ve kept switching the icons in their software, they can’t seem to settle with one idea. On mobile, the check-mark doesn’t even appear anywhere.
- You can’t shuffle-play from the now-playing page on the mobile app.

**2. iOS 12**

iOS 13 actually solves a lot of these problems but I figured what the heck.

- The clock app and calculator app have a black and orange color scheme not seen anywhere else in the phone. And the compass is just a black scheme.
- The orange color in the Notes app is a different orange from the one in the clock app…and this one doesn’t show up anywhere else, as far as I know
- Reminders app does not automatically assume that you want your reminder to come at a specific time.
- Photos app doesn’t let you keep captions for a photo! This is one of the most frustrating! I want to search my photos by caption instead of looking for a photo by just guessing when I took it!! I’m more likely to remember what I wrote about the photo rather than the date I took it.
- While texting in iMessage, you may have noticed that they updated all the different things you can share as modules i.e. a photo, app, gestures, music etc. However, for some strange reason, the camera is still separate, and not included as a module even though the photos app is.
- I’ll also talk about this in my Windows criticism but having a Windows laptop and an iPhone, there’s literally no native way for me to share files between my phone and my computer besides emailing it to myself. Nothing like Airdrop or iMessage to myself. There’s other apps and whatever that let me share but nothing native. The easiest approach I’ve found is sending my file to my brother on WhatsApp, asking him to ignore it, and then opening WhatsApp Web on my computer. It’s so sad.

**3. MacOS Mojave**

- When I go into Chrome full screen mode, every time I go up to change tabs, I trigger the top desktop bar. So frustrating. It’s not even a pretty animation or smooth at all like most things on MacOS are; it’s just a straight up pop in and pop out. I dream of a day I can just drift my mouse to the top and change tabs with ease.
- The touch bar. Everybody just loves not having a physical escape button and triggering Siri every 15 seconds. To me, it’s just a fancy volume slider.
- Dear god, save me from the screenshot experience. Mojave recently updated the screenshot shortcut Cmd+Shift+4 and Cmd+Shift+5 to both allow you to take a partial screenshot of your screen, whereas only the former did that before. However, they both use a different UI to do so!
- Following from that, I really appreciate how they now give a postview for you screenshot on the bottom right. But I hate how it disappears after a short time. As it is, after I take the screenshot, it’s a race between me and the timer to navigate to the app where I need to share the screenshot. I know I can just save it but I really prefer just keeping it there until I need it so I can just drag it on the platform I need it in.
- Saving a screenshot! Automatically saves to your desktop with the file name “Screenshot” plus the timestamp. That way, if you need to share the screenshot immediately, you navigate to the Desktop on Finder, wade through the sea of other screenshots you’ve taken because the most recent one still gets sorted lexicographically rather than by the timestamp until you get to the one you were looking for by peering at this tiny preview. The worst part is, you click on the postview, and Cmd+S to save, it doesn’t even let you write the filename! So if you wanted to find it afterward, you actually literally always have to go through the sea, find the screenshot, rename, and move it to the place you want to save. The majority of the times, I don’t even need to save the screenshot, so I have to go back in after I share it, find it a second time, and delete it.

**4. Remotes**

- Remotes are horrible to use; typing out a long string of letters like the name of a show is painful.
