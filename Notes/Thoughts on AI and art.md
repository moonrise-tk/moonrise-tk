Artificial Intelligence is a term that‚Äôs thrown around a lot to make technology seem futuristic. Everybody defines it differently though, so it‚Äôs pretty easy to make your product seem a lot more impressive than it really is.

For me, we will have achieved general artificial intelligence when a  machine learns to make art. That may not seem like a very good definition because art is defined vaguely too, but let me explain.

When a human designs art, it‚Äôs the expression of feelings visually. Now, feelings are infinitely more complex than visual art can ever be. So art can be seen as wrapping and folding those feelings down into the dimensions we communicate in, i.e. our 3-D sight, smell, touch, taste, hearing.

All of our actions as humans are driven by feelings. You feel hungry so you eat. You feel lonely so you go talk to your friends. There are pleasant feelings and unpleasant ones. In a way, we are always driving toward ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù homeostasis. It makes sense then, if a machine could have its own feelings, its attempts to express them could be considered art.

But why would a machine want to express its feelings or communicate them? Similarly, why do humans create art? I believe it‚Äôs linked with us being social creatures. We want others to feel what we feel. If we‚Äôre sad, we want others to feel sad with us. So art is just a way for other people to receive our feelings. How accurate it can even be to the original feeling is a separate question entirely, but we try to reduce it into letters, shapes, colors, etc.

So if a machine were to create art, that would mean the machine experiences emotions that it's trying to communicate. The ability for the machine to have feelings in more dimensions than can be communicated in is what makes it intelligent. If a machine is trying to make art, maybe to present to a human, it‚Äôs trying to show the human a glimpse into how it truly feels.

How will we know when a machine created art? It's hard to tell, but if it truly struggles to make this art, if it wrestles with how to communicate its emotions in a way we can understand it best, it‚Äôs evidence that it‚Äôs thinking beyond the surface level code we used to make it. So in a way, the definition is actually cyclical: we know a machine is intelligent when it creates art...but we only know its art when the machine has emotions i.e. it's intelligent.

So then the question becomes, what about this whole feeling business makes us human? Why are feelings so central to human behavior that I believe artificial intelligence should be solely characterized by its ability to express and feel them?

This is related a lot to how [[Feelings are just thoughts we haven't understood yet]]. Maybe computers just have surface level thoughts without feelings behind them
