# Resumés should be dynamic

Resumes are often made static i.e. PDF or printed out. 

However, different job applications require different resumés, since different skills need to be highlighted. This would mean a different resumé would need to be created for each application, but it also requires guesswork by the applicant to guess which skills would be most appreciated by the reviewer.

This problem is exacerbated for me since I tend to be very generalized and my knowledge and interests are scattered across physics, many different programming languages and frameworks, and design. 

A dynamic resumé like the one I've made not only allows me to have all my experience in one place, but also allows the reviewer to choose the experience and projects that *they* are interested in and seeing them in detail rather than seeing *all* of my experience and projects with no detail.

This idea can be viewed as me just shifting the filter work to the reviewer...but I've worked hard to provide numerous views so it's easy to navigate. I also provided a PDF version if they're not feeling it.
