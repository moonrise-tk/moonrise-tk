# I'm capable because of my privilege

I've had a lot of privilege in my life; I grew up in CT in a low-crime neighborhood, with a well-off family, a good schooling system, and eventually, a pretty good college. All these have given me the freedom, tools, and knowledge to find problems and make solutions. 

Not only that, but I can learn quickly. I've spent so much time learning new things, that I'm good at it. Learning to code in a new language takes weeks, not years and learning a new library takes hours not weeks.

All this is attributable solely to my privilege; where I was born and who I was born to.
