# Parentheses are a way of branching text

So texts are typically linear: you read them word by word and up to down, and there's no "branches". I realized though that the way we use parentheses in text actually kind of simulates a "branch" though. Think about the following sentence:

> So I usually love tea (except right after I eat something sweet because then the tea tastes terrible), but this tea happened to be *especially* good.

The clause "except right after I eat something ..." is related to the first clause "So I usually love tea" but unrelated to the third clause "but this tea...". So the way I've used parentheses here actually allows a branch in the text and I can say two things related to the first clause but unrelated to each other. This is really interesting because I've noticed that Andy Matuschak's notes often contain a lot of parentheses. I use them less often but still more frequently than I used to.

Foot notes are also a way of branching text! You say something in the context of something else, but you don't have the space to explain it right away so you explain it afterward, or you point out some other unrelated fact.
