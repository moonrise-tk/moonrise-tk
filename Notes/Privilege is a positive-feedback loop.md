# Privilege is a positive-feedback loop

Although [[I'm capable because of my privilege]], I'm not going to use the capability to help people that are *not* like me because [[People usually care about their own problems]]. Therefore, I will only end up furthering *my* society, rather than the society that really needs it. 

Doesn't that seem like a positive feedback loop? People with privilege have so much power but they focus on issues that other people with privilege face rather than issues of people without it.

It seems like the same privilege that gives me so much power to build things is also what restricts me to using that power to worry about issues that seem so minuscule.
