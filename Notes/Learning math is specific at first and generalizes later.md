# Learning math is specific at first and generalizes later

When people learn math, it's always the most concrete concepts first, i.e. numbers. Then, only as they advance, they learn about functions, then matrices, then tensors. 

This is similar to how [programming is a cycle of generalizing and implementing](https://www.notion.so/Programming-is-a-cycle-of-generalizing-and-implementing-f2a5d8f2c0c64d17a33303611e44ed8b), since as a programmer explores their own program like learning math, they are slowly generalizing.

But it also makes the problem with that approach more clear too: a new user joining a program 2 years after release is gonna have a steep learning curve, b/c it'll be like teaching matrices to someone who doesn't yet understand numbers.
