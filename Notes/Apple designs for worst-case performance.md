# Apple designs for worst-case performance

Apple's iOS 14 still supports the original iPhone SE, a phone launched in 2016. 4 years ago doesn't sound great, but to consider the leaps and bounds both iOS and the iPhone have made in those 4 years, and still support that far back is a tremendous achievement. 

That's not all; I haven't tried iOS 14 on the SE but iOS 13 still runs flawlessly. People have not believed me when I've said my phone runs the latest operating system so smoothly. I see this as a common thread through most of Apple's software; it tends to abstract away most of the details to the user very well.

A notable exception is Apple Music on MacOS. Apple Music sucks when I don't have a reliable network connection. Nothing loads, and the error messages are unclear and tucked away in a corner. I didn't know the error messages were being thrown until very recently.
