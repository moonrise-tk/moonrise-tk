# Content vs Structure

When I learn a new idea or concept, I've noticed that the information I learn can be split into two high-level groups: content and structure. 

With content, I'm referring to cold hard facts i.e. knowing that `np.matmul` should be used for matrix multiplication, or that mitochondria break up glucose and generate ATP.

With structure, I'm referring to how the content fits together as a whole and the organization of the content. For example, the cell is a basic unit of life that contains different organelles, that each have different properties and roles of which mitochondria is one.

It's hard to explain well in words, but with some examples, hopefully it's more clear:
***

**Content:** Numpy, matplotlib, and scikit are Python libraries.

**Structure:** Numpy, matplotlib and scikit were written by other people and made available to the public. You can download them to your computer and call their functions in your Python code.

**Content:** kNN uses the classification of k nearest neighbors to classify a test point.

**Structure:** kNN is one way to find the classification of a test point. There exists others, like linear regression and logistic regression.

**Content:** How to code in React.

**Structure:** React is a javascript framework. It's an *alternative* to creating websites through pure javascript and html and it's used for various reasons like speed, ease-of-use, etc. 

**Content:** Knowing the input types and output types of a specific Python function.

**Structure:** Knowing the function's alternatives, its advantages, understanding how that function fits into that library's context.

Hopefully that's more clear? I'm not sure if it's a hard line of distinction. The reason I think it's important to talk about this though is when people are learning a completely new concept, they are learning both its content and structure. 

This all may make sense, but the problem arises when they're taking notes that restrict them to one kind of structure, i.e. desktops often have a hierarchical file/folder structure or the notes app on iPhone is very linear. Humans are often forced to think of ways to conform the material they're learning to the same structure as the medium of their notes, when it should really be the other way around (the structure of your notes should follow the structure of the learning material). This is part of why paper is nice; having no restrictions on structure (at least on a given page), lets you define any sort of structure you see fit.

I think in the end, every structure is a "subclass" of the associative structure: there are entities and they have relationships between them. Every other kind of structure is achieved by assigning stricter rules on that (a "tree" structure assigns hierarchies, and a "list" has an order to the way the relationships should be traversed).

In Nielsen and Matuschak's "How can we develop transformative tools for thought", they mention "declarative knowledge" like "lists of American Presidents, capitals of countries, and so on" vs. "conceptual knowledge" like "abstract, conceptual knowledge, the kind of knowledge required to learn subjects such as quantum mechanics and quantum computing". I don't know if this is a 1:1 relationship between the content/structure line I made, but it seems related.
