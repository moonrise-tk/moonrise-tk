# Adding content to a software after release

I read this tweet the other day:

and I thought the person's concerns were interesting. Usually when content gets added to game after its release (for free), players rejoice. Why not? It's free content. For example, with No Man's Sky, the game was garbage when it was released and didn't fulfill any of its promises but years of free updates from the developers finally made players happy. The case is the same with Destiny and Fortnite, where regular updates introducing new content have become a part of the game. 

However, this tweeter looks at the business model differently: instead of thinking of the content being added to the game afterwards as free and extra, they treat it as content that was "withheld" from launch. The reason they can think of it as withheld is because they draw comparisons to the previous Animal Crossing game, that had all of the content to begin with when the game was released.

I don't think it's a fair comparison. I've never played New Leaf, but many people seem to agree that the games are similar, and New Leaf offers more in terms of content but New Horizons has more freedom, and much better graphics. 

The tweeter also argues that it took them a year to complete New Leaf, but only three months to feel burnt out with New Horizons. I think, since she's already played New Leaf, it's not really a fair comparison since she might have just gone through the game faster because she's played it before.  

They argue that adding new content later once people have their "island layouts" will be "disastrous" but I look it at as an opportunity to change your island, letting you spend more time in the game, countering burnout.

In the context of how [[Programming is a cycle of generalizing and impleme f2a5d8f2c0c64d17a33303611e44ed8b|Programming is a cycle of generalizing and implementing]], adding content to a software after release actually makes lots of sense since it gets people invested into a simple product before it gets complex and large. The problem here though may be that for someone like the twitter user, who has played all the previous games, are already familiar with where the game can go, so they're already eager for the game's content.
