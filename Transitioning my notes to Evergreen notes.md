# Transitioning my notes to Evergreen notes

[Â§Note-writing systems](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zhmLXArqiCMDr9Q13ViqN3hh3SmrKzjQxWAr)

Reading about evergreen notes made a lot of sense to me:

- I often have disconnected thoughts relating ideas and topics, but I can't make myself make a page for them in this database bc they don't feel like big enough or complete topics. The idea of evergreen notes changes this, because I can think of my notes as something that grows over time, rather than a complete idea I've fleshed out.
- This transition has already inspired me to create links between my notes, but Notion doesn't quite make that easy (I have to go back, copy paste think link to my note, format it in that page, I'm too lazy...). That's why I hope to eventually make my own note taking system the same way Andy Matuschak's website is set up. There are some thing I'd want to change though. Right now, his notes are indigestible to an average reader. I'd want some way to see my notes as a network and navigate them, so they're easier to reflect on, and they're easier for people to navigate.

Started thinking about my own note-taking app idea!!

Btw I've gotten into evergreen notes so much more than I thought I would. I normally despise writing, but evergreen notes lift the pressure of needing my notes to have a lot of content. So, I can just write a few sentences, and be happy with it. I've also learned a lot more by being able to connect seemingly disconnected thoughts together.
