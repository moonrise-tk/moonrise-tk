# Starting notes with a question is beneficial

I've found that as I'm writing these notes, the best way to approach them is to think of a specific, atomic question that I'm trying to answer. Then the goal of the note is to answer that specific question, and then I end with an answer. I then change the title of the note to the answer I discovered. An example is if my question was "What is the best way to do X" and then the answer will be "Y is the best way to do X". Changing the title to a statement allows me to easily use it inline inside other notes.

This is related a lot to my idea that [[People employ the scientific method when iterating]]. If you think of notes as reflections, and as people trying to learn, then the note title is a question/hypothesis. The note becomes a soft "proof". Then the question gets turned into a statement and the person walks away having learned something.
