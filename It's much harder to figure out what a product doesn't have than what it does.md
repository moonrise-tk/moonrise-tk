# It's much harder to figure out what a product doesn't have than what it does

I was looking for if Matlab had "plugins". It has what it calls "plugins" to do other things but the typical concept of a plugin is not there. I didn't really understand this, until I entered a forum with someone asking the same question and the answer explained Matlab doesn't have them. 

The point is that Matlab didn't make it clear that it didn't have plugins; and for good reason. Why would they publicize something they don't have? It doesn't make any sense from a marketing perspective; you always advertise the gains of your product.

But for a consumer it can be very confusing. When introduced to a new product, everyone's first instinct is to compare to other products, and weigh what they have/don't have. Usually we have to wait for reviews by other people to figure out if a product is good, but why do you have to make your consumers hear it from other people when you could just tell them?

A funny counterexample is Nintendo. In their Switch Lite announcement, they talked a lot about what isn't there:

Another one is Fibery's "Just another collaboration tool" web page:

[Fibery | Yet another collaboration tool](https://fibery.io/anxiety)

As funny as these are, they're actually pretty meaningful and helpful. In the Switch Lite's case, the comparison to the regular switch is made explicit. In Fibery's case, negatives about the product like no mobile apps, steep learning curve, questions about reliability are made crystal clear. This page could actually be very helpful to someone wondering if they can switch out using their tool with Fibery. 

Sure, making a product's flaws more clear might lead to less users, but if they aren't made clear, then initially a product will have a large rush of users that slowly drop out later as they realize the tool isn't what they thought it was. Even worse, it leaves a bad taste in people's mouths and impacts your brand. 

Look at Facebook and Google that did not make their flaws and their business model (through collecting and selling data) clear to consumers. Sure they are massive now, but the data collection policies are clear to most people at this point and have turned them off. 

Even with this issues, it might be preferable to just keep the flaws of the product hidden. The choice (in my opinion) comes down choosing between your product's users swelling at launch with people who don't understand it properly and a user base that grows slowly but whose population is committed to the product.

In my opinion, the latter is far better. People should always be happy using what you made. From an economical standpoint, the latter might still be better. Studies often show that recommendations from other people are far more effective than advertisements into convincing a user to try a product. For example, look at [Five Guys](https://www.mashed.com/80154/untold-truth-five-guys/).

Maybe I've abstracted the problem too far away now, but all the connections still hold. With relationships between people, complete transparency is always ideal. Why should it be different with companies?
