### Hi there 👋

I'm a student at Carnegie Mellon University studying physics 🔭 and computer science 💻. In my free time, I play frisbee 🥏.

This repository contains some random thoughts of mine. I'm currently working on an interface to display them.

If you'd like to reach out to me, the best way is through my email (tkanchar@andrew.cmu.edu). If you'd like to learn more about me, my website is [moonrise.tk](www.moonrise.tk)
