# People employ the scientific method when iterating

This starts with how [people recognize patterns when processing](https://www.notion.so/People-recognize-patterns-when-processing-96880b332032421394f74d0235025d13). After recognizing a suitable pattern (oh, f(100) will require f(99) and f(98), which will require f(97) and f(96), etc.), we try to prove it. In this case, the proof is self-evident; we understand the Fibonacci function and that it decreases by one in each iteration. There are no surprises; f(40) won't suddenly be 0 instead of f(39)+f(38). 

So we take this pattern, which is our hypothesis, and then we prove it (i.e. application of the scientific method). Usually the proof is more so someone convincing themselves. For example, in UI, maybe the pattern noticed is that logging in can be difficult for the user. We prove it by trying to log in ourselves (ah yes, I have to navigate through multiple different interfaces to get to the login screen.) Then, in the next iteration, we resolve the conclusion and make getting to the login screen easier, just like how we resolved the calculation of the Fibonacci numbers and skipped straight to f(1) to start from there.
