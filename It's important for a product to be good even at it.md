# It's important for a product to be good even at its worst

A product that other people need to use needs to be perfection at its best and good at its worst. At its best, a product runs with no errors, no need to debug, on perfect hardware with a flawless network connection by an expert who has worked with the project for years. At its worst, it's running with many errors, lots of bugs, on sketchy hardware with a low bandwidth, high latency network connection, by someone who just looked up the product an hour and ago decided to give it a try.

For example, any software like Tensorflow, Keras, PyTorch, Python, FaceID, new iOS, new Android, and countless examples usually present a demo of the software running flawlessly (just run this jupyter notebook and it'll work!) but never a demo of the software running into lots of bugs, errors, etc. 

This a problem because the median experience of someone falls far closer to the latter than the former, especially if they're trying to use the product for their own needs.

Note that a simple product that took a few hours of development will be much easier to understand and use than one that has had thousands or tens of thousands of man-hours of development. Why is this? It's probably because [programming is a cycle of generalizing and implementing](https://www.notion.so/Programming-is-a-cycle-of-generalizing-and-implementing-f2a5d8f2c0c64d17a33303611e44ed8b), and the more time is spent on a product improving it, the harder it is too learn for a user.
