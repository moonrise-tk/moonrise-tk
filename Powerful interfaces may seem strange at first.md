I agree with this statement, original tweeted by Michael Nielsen. I felt this way about Twitter, and Notion to a slightly lesser extent. I completely missed this on Hey, and lo and behold, about a week later, I have completely stopped using it. 

I like this way of thinking because it encourages deeper thought when producing something, rather than the easy way of producing something cliched and familiar to users.
