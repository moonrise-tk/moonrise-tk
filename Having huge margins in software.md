# Having huge margins in software

I've always despised the look of Microsoft Outlook. The UI has always looked very cluttered, messy and confusing to me. On the other hand, Notion, as I'm sure many would agree looks very pleasing. I was thinking about why this might be the case, and I came to the conclusion that at least part of the problem is margins. Notion has very large margins on both left and right sides of a page, but Outlook has very small margins.

The empty space on the left and right sides of the page is massive!

For the notion screenshot, the content in the middle of the page has been distinctly separated from the menu on the left and the right edge. On the other hand, Outlook has nearly zero margins between my inboxes on the left, the stream of emails, and the content. It also has very little spacing between the menu items on the top bar, making them look very clumped. 

It's not clear why having large margins can have such a big difference. If you're just using spacing to separate items from one another, why not just use a divider? Visually, they will look separated and you won't lose space. 

I think the difference comes down to when a user is trying to focus on the item. It's easier to focus (at least for me) on an item (whether it's an email's content, inbox I'm trying to open, or a specific button from the tool bar) when there's empty space around it.

To test my theory that Outlook is ugly to me because of the lack of margins, I should try and edit the UI and space things out better to see if they'll make a difference.

I tried. It still needs a lot of work but I already think it feels loads better than the other one.
