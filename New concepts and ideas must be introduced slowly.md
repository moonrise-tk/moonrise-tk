# New concepts and ideas must be introduced slowly
In Andy Matuschak's and Michael Nielsen's essay "How can we develop transformative tools for thought?", they point this out: 

> But it would help in addressing one core difficulty: the overwhelming number of new concepts and notation.

They mention that overwhelming new concepts/notation is the reason learning quantum mechanics for people fails. The same can be applied for most software systems. For example, people learning a new language might usually fail unless they're taught be a professional. But for someone who has learned a language, it's a lot easier to learn concepts in other programming languages. This is linked to how [[Privilege is a positive-feedback loop]], since only people with access to high-quality teaching can learn multiple languages and be successful. 

Going back to the other idea, most software systems introduce a lot of notation very quickly, like Notion's blocks, Figma's artboards, etc. People who are new to the software will feel overwhelmed. In my notes app, I wanted to tackle this by introducing features incrementally. It's not exactly the mnemonic medium Nielsen and Matuschak talk about but I'm not sure how that could be implemented in terms of software.
